### Outlook of my projects over the years: 

1. GymPal
This collaborative project, developed by James Burriss, Landon Casstevens, Brandon Plyler, Michael Gogarty, and Riley Simpson, enables users to connect with gym partners in their area while offering a fitness tracking system. Built using Dart and Flutter, it incorporates Firebase for database management and Google Maps for geo-location and gym discovery, ensuring a seamless user experience.

2. Betting Algorithm Analysis (In Progress)
This project leverages Power BI to aggregate and process player statistics from extensive databases. The resulting data is used to generate insights and power an algorithm that provides actionable information to players, highlighting trends and opportunities within a unified interface.

3. Booth Reservation System
This web application was developed to streamline the booth reservation process for the 2025 Padel World Summit. Designed during an internship with Cl√∫ster Internacional Padel (CIP) in Barcelona, the system automates reservation workflows, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience for exhibitors. The project integrates responsive web design with robust back-end functionality, enhancing the organization and accessibility of event logistics.

4. Manatee Tracking Application
A real-time application designed to track manatees, featuring a custom user interface powered by Java and JavaScript. Users can access live updates and detailed profile information on each manatee, making it a practical and engaging tool for marine life enthusiasts.

5. Ethical Debate of Autonomous Vehicles (Research Paper)
This research explores the ethical and legal implications of autonomous vehicles, analyzing decision-making dilemmas through deontological and utilitarian frameworks. Key considerations include public perception, legal liability, and societal integration of AVs. This work advocates for a balanced ethical framework to ensure safety and uphold human dignity in the age of automation.

6. DNA Sequencing and Fuzzy Searching  (Research Paper)
This bioinformatics study examines algorithms like Smith-Waterman, BLAST, and Approximate Boyer-Moore for DNA sequence analysis. The research emphasizes fuzzy searching techniques to manage genetic variations, enabling efficient and accurate identification of similar sequences, crucial for advancements in genomic research.
